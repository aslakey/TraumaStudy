<b>Background:<b> Surgical site infections (SSI) have a great impact on morbidity and mortality in the surgical patient. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma has established guidelines for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in penetrating abdominal trauma. We aimed to determine SSI associated risk factors in patients sustaining penetrating abdominal trauma with hollow viscus injury, analyze perioperative antibiotic type and administration, and determine adherence to recommended guidelines.
